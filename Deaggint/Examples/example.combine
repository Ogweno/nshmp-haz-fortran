	combining data files
The file addhaz.345 is an example of the list of files and their corresponding weights that are used
when combining data from various runs. There are several reasons for combining: (1) check if current
model SA (PGA) is OK or needs updating (iterating), and (2), how to combine for final deagg report. These files
go away automatically after their raison d'etre has ceased. 
After the weight field is a source-info flag. This is used by the deagg to tie the file to a broad source
category. See sum_haz.2008.f for the details.
